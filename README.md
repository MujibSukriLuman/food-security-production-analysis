this project aims to determine the progress of policies and strategies implemented in terms of food security in the wold.

*Here is the project of food security survival for all coutries in the world, but it is more focussed on my beloved country Indonesia ♥️, I think just different databases but the theory and practical concepts are the same.*

*food security is defined when all people, at all times, have pyhsical and economic access to sufficient safe and nutritious food that meets their diartary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. there are many dimensions of food security, but in this project just focus on physical availability of food: food availability address the "supply side" of food security and is determined by the level of food production, stock lavels and net trade.

**Business Understanding :**
Ability to make yield prediction before harvest using satellite remote sensing is important in many aspects of agricultural decision-making. Crop yield forecasts a few months before harvest can be of importance for timely initiating food trade secure the national demand and timely organize food transport within countries.*

* Crop yield Forecasting enables planners and decision makers to determine how much to import or optionally if there in shortfall case, to export in surplus position. in here, we need domain knowlage to surgery deeper about this term. domain knowlage is like my compass in any domain, whether it’s healthcare, finance, marketing, or any other.
the food security for product analysis of the next rice harvest. in this case, trying to combine between satellite remote sensing and statistical data from government.
  
1. understanding of goal project
   - in this case, maintaining and improving indonesia`s food security for each year(at least 10 years ago)
2. Identify problems
   - Indonesia import rice almost every year, what the factors couse it ?
   - whether the rice harvest is small form the growers ?
   - if yes, what coused it ?
   - shortage of fertilizer
   - weather
   - lack of interest in growers or there are other factors
3. Determine the success of the harvest
   - has the country ever not imported? if has, in what year ?
   - what coused it?
4. Understand the process involved understanding of workflow to selling
   from growers-merchants-resellers-market-public

futhermore, as a data scientist
